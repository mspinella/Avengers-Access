		<h2>Bio</h2>
	<div class="info">
		<p>Hawkeye is also known as Clint Barton, a highly skilled marksman. Hawkeye is an amazing archer. He has designed variants to his arrows. Apart ftom the traditional arrows, some of them explode on impact. He is married and has children, but he doesn't talk about them much because he wants to keep them safe. He had them placed in a remote area to ensure their protection. He has a very close relationship to Black Widow and he has taken on the role of mentor to the young Scarlet Witch. In the battle against Ultron, Hawkeye was almost killed, but Quicksilver sacrificed himself to save him.</p>

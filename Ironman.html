		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Ironman is one of the original Avengers.
			He is also known as Tony Stark, a billionaire and incredible engineer. He suffered a chest injury during a kidnapping, where he was being forced to build a weapon of mass destruction. He created this powerful suit of armor to save his life and protect him in battle. His parents were murdered when he was a young boy by the Winter Soldier. He is married to Pepper Potts, who was originally his personal secretary. Stark and Captain America don't always see eye-to-eye. While Captain America always wants to go out and save everyone, Stark wants to create robots to save people. This way he doesn't always have to get involved and he can have time to relax. However, while trying to create these robots, he accidentally creates Ultron, a major villain to the Avengers.</p>

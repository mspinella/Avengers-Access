		<h2>Bio</h2>
	<div class="info">
		<p>Quicksilver, also known as Pietro Maximoff, was a part of an experiment with his twin sister Scarlet Witch. This experiment was conducted by Wolfgang von Strucker, who got hold of Loki's mystical scepter. Using the magic from the scepter, he was able to give people incredible powers. Quicksilver is from the country of Sokovia. Quicksilver, along with his sister Scarlet Witch and the other Avengers, fought against Ultron and his army. The battle took place in his home country of Sokovia and much of the country was destroyed in the fight. Quicksilver fought valiantly with the other Avengers, but he sacraficed himself to save fellow Avenger Hawkeye.</p>

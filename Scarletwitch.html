		<h2>Bio</h2>
	<div class="info">
		<p>Scarlet Witch, also known as Wanda Maximoff, was a part of an experiment with her twin brother Quicksilver. This experiment was conducted by Wolfgang von Strucker, who got hold of Loki's mystical scepter. Using the magic from the scepter, he was able to give people incredible powers. Scarlet Witch is from the country of Sokovia. In the fight against Ultron, Sokovia became a battlefield and many of the country's inhabitants were killed. However, Scarlet Witch and the other Avengers were able to stop Ultron before he could destroy the rest of the planet.</p>

He was enhanced by an experimental serum to become a perfect specimen. His costume is red, white and blue, made to look like the American flag. He wields a red, white and blue shield, made of vibranium, making it indestructable. He has so much love for his country and always does what is right, in order to keep peace and justice. Due to his enhancement, he was able to aid the United States in World War II. Near the end of the war he was frozen in a block of ice and then was revived in present day.
